# Set Cover Problem - Lab 1

## Problem Statement

This lab required solving instances of the Set Cover Problem with varying universe sizes, number of sets, and densities. The objective was to implement a solution that efficiently handles these variations and reports the initial and final fitness values.

The goal is to **find the minimum-cost subfamily of `S`** such that the union of these subsets covers `U`.

## Approach

The implemented Tabu Search algorithm for the Set Cover Problem includes:

- **Dynamic Tabu List**: Starts with an initial size and grows as the search progresses, balancing between exploration and exploitation.
- **Aspiration Criteria**: Allows accepting moves in the tabu list if they lead to a solution better than the best found so far.
- **Multiple Mutation**: Generates diverse neighborhood solutions by potentially flipping multiple bits in the solution representation.
- **Fitness Tracking**: Monitors and stores the fitness of solutions throughout the search process.
- **Multi-Instance Testing**: Applies the algorithm to multiple problem instances with varying parameters, demonstrating its adaptability to different problem scales.
- **Results Visualization**: Provides graphical representation of the algorithm's performance for each instance, aiding in analysis and comparison.

The solution was tested across multiple instances, demonstrating its effectiveness in finding optimal or near-optimal solutions.

## Results

## Performance Analysis

- The algorithm consistently improved the initial random solutions, the algorithm doesn't work well for 100,000. Haven't figured out why yet. 
- Larger instances (100,000 universe size) required significantly more computation time.
- Density variations impacted the ease of finding valid solutions.

## Challenges and Optimizations

- **Memory Management**: Implemented efficient data structures for large instances.
- **Runtime Optimization**: Used vectorized operations where possible.
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjusted tabu list size and mutation rate for different instance sizes.
- **Biggest Challenge**: testing the algo on 100,000 universe size on my 6-year-old laptop was like using the free version of ChatGPT during peak hours.

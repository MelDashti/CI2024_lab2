# Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) Solver

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using both a greedy approximate algorithm and a more accurate algorithm. The goal of the project is to determine the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.

## Lab Requirements

The requirements for the lab are as follows:
- Solve the given TSP instances using both a fast but approximate algorithm and a slower, yet more accurate one.
- Report the final cost and the number of steps taken in each approach.
- The instances considered are provided in a CSV file containing the names and coordinates (latitude and longitude) of cities in Italy.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is a CSV file containing a list of cities in Italy with their corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates. The dataset is structured as follows:
